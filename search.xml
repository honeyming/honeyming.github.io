    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Vienna remains the most livable city for 2019 out of 140 surveyed by The Economist Intelligence Unit. Cities are assessed for stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure. (CNN) — It’s long been known for its grandiose architecture, lashings of green spaces and traditional coffee shops – and now Vienna is building itself a reputation for something even more covetable. The Austrian capital has been ranked the world’s most livable city for the second year running, topping the table with almost perfect scores for stability, culture and environment, education and infrastructure, and health care. … Lucie Lamster Thury, a New Yorker who moved to Vienna in 2004 and runs shopping toursof the city, said Vienna “taught me how to live. “Coming from Manhattan it was hard to slow down but I love the pace of Vienna. It’s relatively quiet, clean and culturally abundant, and I’ve never felt safer in Europe or in the States. I thought I’d never get used to shops being closed on Sundays, but it has changed my life – people actually get to rest here, and private life is as important as work.”]]></content>
